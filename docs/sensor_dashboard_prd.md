# Sensor Monitoring Dashboard PRD - Sweet Impastries

## 1. Overview

Sweet Impastries is developing a custom web-based sensor monitoring dashboard to support food safety compliance and operational efficiency. This system will integrate with the SensorPush Gateway Cloud API to retrieve real-time and historical environmental data (e.g., temperature and humidity) from multiple bakery sensors. Data will be stored locally in a SQLite database and visualized for bakery staff in a simple, mobile-friendly web interface. The dashboard will allow staff to quickly identify sensor anomalies, track historical trends, and ensure regulatory compliance for food storage conditions.

## 2. Goals & Objectives

- **Real-time Monitoring**: Display the current readings for each SensorPush device with updates every minute (defined as "near real-time" for this application). Refresh interval should be user-configurable globally in whole-minute increments.
- **Historical Data Access**: View data over selectable time slices: Last hour, Today, Past 24 hours, Past 7 days, Past 30 days.
- **Graphical Visualization**: Line graphs showing temperature and humidity over time.
- **Sensor Filtering**: Filter dashboard data by individual sensor.
- **Mobile-Friendly Design**: Optimized for iPads and tablets.
- **Local Data Storage**: Store data in SQLite for simplicity and persistence.
- **Offline Access**: Deferred to post-MVP phase due to low priority.
